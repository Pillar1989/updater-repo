= Quickstart projects for meta-updater

== Getting started

This repo is not to be cloned directly, use https://source.android.com/source/downloading.html[Android repo]
tool instead:

    repo init -u https://github.com/advancedtelematic/updater-repo.git -m <project>
    repo sync

Convenience script is provided to set up your environment to produce OTA-enabled image
for your machine

    source meta-updater/scripts/envsetup.sh <machine>

Then you can build the required image (core-image-minimal is a good start)

    bitbake core-image-minimal

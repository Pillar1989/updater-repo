= Quickstart projects for meta-updater

== Getting started

This repo is not to be cloned directly, use https://source.android.com/source/downloading.html[Android repo]
tool instead:

    sudo apt-get install repo
    repo init -u https://github.com/advancedtelematic/updater-repo.git
    repo sync -j8

Install the OpenEmbedded build dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install gawk wget git-core diffstat unzip texinfo gcc-multilib \
     build-essential chrpath socat libsdl1.2-dev xterm repo

A convenience script is provided to set up your environment to produce OTA-enabled image
for your machine:

    source meta-updater/scripts/envsetup.sh <machine> # One of intel-corei7-64 (for Minnowboard), raspberrypi3, or qemux86-64


Then you can build the required image (core-image-minimal is a good start)

    bitbake core-image-minimal


For instructions how to link the device to ATS Garage, see http://docs.atsgarage.com/start-yocto/your-first-ostreeenabled-yocto-project.html


== Running the image (Minnowboard Max/Turbot)

Write the image with the following command (replace /dex/sdX with the correct device for your microSD card):

    sudo dd if=tmp/deploy/images/intel-corei7-64/core-image-minimal-intel-corei7-64.wic of=/dev/sdX bs=32M && sync

The image file Yocto generates is shrunk down to the smallest it can be. After writing it to your SD card, youâ€™ll want to expand the partition and root filesystem so they use the whole disk:

    sudo parted  /dev/sdX
    (parted) resizepart
    Warning: Not all of the space available to /dev/sdh appears to be used, you can fix the GPT to use all of the space (an extra 15346552 blocks) or continue with the current setting?
    Fix/Ignore? fix
    Partition number? 2
    End?  [112MB]? 100%
    (parted) quit
    sudo resize2fs /dev/sdX2

Now insert the microSD card in the Minnowboard Max and boot it.

== Running the image (Raspberry Pi 3)

Build the `rpi-basic-image`:

    bitbake rpi-basic-image

Write it to a SD card:

    sudo dd if=tmp/deploy/images/raspberrypi3/rpi-basic-image-raspberrypi3.rpi-sdimg-ota of=/dev/sdh bs=32M && sync
    sudo parted -s /dev/sdX resizepart 2 '100%'
    sudo resize2fs /dev/sdX2


== Running the image (Qemu)

    ../meta-updater/scripts/run-qemu-ota <imagename>

This script will run 'core-image-minimal' by default if no image name is given. Use `run-qemu-ota -h` for a list of command line options.

In particular, you may create/use a qcow2-formatted storage overlay file for persistence. If you don't, any changes you make to the image will be lost as soon as qemu terminates. You can do this with `-o mylayer.cow`; that will create the file if it doesn't exist, and use it if it does.
